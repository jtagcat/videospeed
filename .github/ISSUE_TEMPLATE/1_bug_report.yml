Hi and thanks for your interest.

This extension is a fork of the Video Speed Controller Chrome extension, with minor changes to make it work on Firefox.

Please search for already existing issues both in here, and upstream.

If the problem also occurs with the Chrome extension, it should be fixed there.  
Any bugs fixed on there will be available in Firefox too.

Upstream Chromium extension: https://github.com/igrigorik/videospeed
