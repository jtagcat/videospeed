Hi and thanks for your interest.

This extension is a fork of the Video Speed Controller Chrome extension, with minor changes to make it work on Firefox.
It will stay as close as possible to the original.  
https://github.com/igrigorik/videospeed

Any new features should be discussed there, and if implemented they will be available in Firefox too.
